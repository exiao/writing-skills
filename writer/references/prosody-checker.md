# Prosody Checker

Writing has a sound, even when read silently. Good writing has varied rhythm. Bad writing drones. This skill measures the musicality of a piece and fixes the flat spots.

## What Prosody Means for Non-Fiction

- **Rhythm** — the pattern of short and long sentences. Monotone = boring.
- **Tempo** — how fast the piece moves. Dense paragraphs slow it down. One-liners speed it up.
- **Stress** — which words and ideas get emphasis. Bold, italics, sentence position, paragraph breaks.
- **Intonation** — the rise and fall of energy across the piece. Should build, not flatline.

## Process

### Step 1 — Sentence Length Map

Count the word count of every sentence and plot the pattern:

```
S1: 14 ████████████████
S2: 6  ████████
S3: 3  ████
S4: 22 ██████████████████████████
S5: 19 ███████████████████████
S6: 21 █████████████████████████
S7: 4  █████
```

**What to look for:**
- **Monotone runs**: 3+ sentences in a row within ±5 words of each other = robot cadence. **5+ consecutive similar-length sentences is an automatic fail.** Fix by splitting a long one or combining two short ones.
- **Missing punches**: No sentences under 6 words in a section = no emphasis. Short sentences hit hard. Use them.
- **Missing breath**: No sentences over 20 words in a section = staccato fatigue. Longer sentences give the reader space to settle in before the next punch.
- **Vary aggressively**: The ideal pattern is irregular. Long-short-medium-short-long-short. Like jazz, not a metronome. If you can swap two adjacent sentences and nobody would notice, the rhythm is too uniform.

**Reference — Ahmad Jivraj's rhythm:**
> "Everyone talks about AI." (5) / "Nobody wants to talk about oil." (7) / "And that, right there, might be the opportunity." (9)

> "Position sizing isn't about how many dollars you put in." (11) / "It's about how much risk you're taking." (8)

> "Most people can't do it." (5) / "That's precisely why it works." (6)

Short-short-medium. Punch-punch-land.

### Step 2 — Paragraph Tempo Map

Classify each paragraph by tempo:

- **⚡ Fast** (1-2 sentences, under 30 words) — punchy, emphatic, transitional
- **🚶 Medium** (3-4 sentences, 30-80 words) — standard argument building
- **🐢 Slow** (5+ sentences or 80+ words) — dense explanation, data-heavy, deep dive

Map the pattern:

```
¶1:  🚶 Medium (setup)
¶2:  ⚡ Fast (one-liner punch)
¶3:  🐢 Slow (data section)
¶4:  🐢 Slow (more data)
¶5:  🐢 Slow (still going)  ← PROBLEM: three slow in a row
¶6:  ⚡ Fast (transition)
¶7:  🚶 Medium (argument)
```

**Rules:**
- Never more than 2 slow paragraphs in a row without a fast break
- Every section should have at least one ⚡ fast paragraph
- After a dense data section, give the reader a one-liner to breathe
- The opening and closing should be ⚡ or 🚶, never 🐢

### Step 3 — Stress Pattern

Check where emphasis falls. In writing, stress comes from:

**1. Position stress** — The first and last sentences of a section carry the most weight. Are your best lines there, or buried in the middle?
- First sentence = the hook. Should be surprising, specific, or provocative.
- Last sentence = the landing. Should resolve or open a loop.
- If your best insight is in sentence 3 of 5, move it to sentence 1 or 5.

**2. Typographic stress** — Bold, italics, standalone lines. Are you using them intentionally or randomly?
- Bold should highlight the one key insight per section, not decorate every other phrase
- Standalone one-liners get automatic stress — use for your strongest points
- If nothing is bolded or set apart, everything has equal weight = nothing stands out

**3. Structural stress** — Short paragraphs after long ones create emphasis through contrast.
- ❌ Long paragraph. Long paragraph. Long paragraph. (flat)
- ✅ Long paragraph with buildup. Short punch. Medium follow-through. (dynamic)

### Step 4 — Energy Arc

Map the energy level of each section (1-5 scale):

```
Intro:    ████░ (4) — strong hook
Section 1: ███░░ (3) — context setting
Section 2: ██░░░ (2) — uh oh, energy drop
Section 3: ████░ (4) — data that surprises
Section 4: █████ (5) — the "aha" moment
Section 5: ███░░ (3) — practical advice
Closing:   ████░ (4) — strong landing
```

**The ideal energy arc:**
- **Open high** (4-5) — hook them immediately
- **Can dip** (2-3) — for necessary context, but don't stay low for more than one section
- **Build to a peak** (5) — the central insight or "aha"
- **Close high** (4-5) — punchline, not a fizzle

**Red flags:**
- Energy drops below 2 for more than one consecutive section = reader is bored
- Energy never reaches 5 = the piece lacks a clear peak
- Closing is lower energy than opening = the piece deflates

### Step 5 — Read Aloud Test

The ultimate prosody test. Read the piece aloud (or imagine reading it) and mark:
- Where you run out of breath (sentence too long, needs a break)
- Where you stumble (awkward phrasing, tongue twisters)
- Where your voice goes monotone (repetitive structure)
- Where you naturally speed up (good — the writing has pull)
- Where you naturally slow down (good if intentional for emphasis, bad if boring)

## Output Format

Report only what's broken, in this order: monotone runs (with locations), tempo problems,
buried best lines, energy dips, read-aloud stumbles. Then the top 3 pacing fixes.

Skip any section with no findings. Do not print an empty scaffold.
